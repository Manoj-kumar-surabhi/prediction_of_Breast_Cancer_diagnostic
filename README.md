Breast cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the cells of the breast, commonly forming in the milk ducts. It can spread to other parts of the body if untreated. The disease arises from abnormal growth of breast cells, influenced by genetic mutations, hormonal changes, lifestyle factors, or family history. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers globally, primarily affecting women, though men can also develop it.
The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) provides valuable insights into the diagnosis of breast cancer. Created by Dr. William H. Wolberg at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals in 1992, this dataset contains nuclear features derived from fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) biopsy tests of patients' breasts. Early detection and appropriate treatment, such as surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or targeted therapy, are crucial in improving patient outcomes.
To this end, the early identification of BC through screening and detection methods is important so that the disease is identified during its initial stages when malignant cells are local to the breast(s) only. If not caught early, the malignant BC cells spread to other parts of the body and patients are often subjected to much more complex, invasive treatments. Patients with late diagnosis often have lower survival rates and may die soon after being diagnosed.
